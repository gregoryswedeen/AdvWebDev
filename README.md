# AdvWebDev

App Title: WHATS UP THE ROAD?

/home/gregory.swedeen/htdocs/AdvWebDev/Python-3.6.2

Python Version: 3.6

Server File: app.py

HTML Files: All HTML files can be found within the Templates folder

Databases: MySQL username 'gregory.swedeen' password 'KFDP5DAP'
           MongoDB is run locally and does not require any login credentials
           
Setup:
    Once you have changed directories into the AdvWebDev folder, please run these commands:

        Start Environment:

            source ./env/bin/activate


        Install Python 3.6: 
            sudo apt-get install python3.6 
            alias python3='/usr/bin/python3.6' 

            My account is not one of the approved sudo-ers so I am unable to set version to Python3.6
            If Python3.6 is not installed to '/usr/bin/python3.6', run 'whereis Python3.6'

        Install Requirements:

            sudo apt install python3-pip
            pip install -r requirements.txt

            Again, without Python 3.6 the requirements will not be able to be installed
            Pip3 must be used, this will become available once Python3.6 is installed

        Start Mongo:
            
            mongod 
            mongo 

            This will start the mongo server, an additional terminal may need to be opened to continue as this will bring you to the mongo shell.

        Start Server:

            flask run
        
            This will start the web server
